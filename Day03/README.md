Blehhhhh!!!! I had such a time with all the logcal conditions involved in searching around a number in a 2D array. I kept getting the wrong number over and over. Eventually I went through the data and results and found that I didn't have logic that account for a match at the end of a row. When I tried to account for that, I didn't catch the case where the end of the row entry was also a match. I functionalized the search after which it still didn't work. Eventually I found that I had omitted one of the comparison operators in one of my if statements.

The approach I used in part 2 could be cleaned up to apply to part 1 as well. It would make the script better. Maybe I will come back later and fix it up. 

Part 1 Answer is 554003
Part 2 Answer is 87263515
