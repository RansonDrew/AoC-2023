Part 1 was pretty straight forward.
Part 2 was not bad either. It took me some head scratching and hair pulling to wrap my head around how the subsequent cards' instance property needed to be incremented. In my haste, I was setting the upperbound of an inner loop too low (like lower than the lower bound).

Part 1 Answer is 20407
Part 2 Answer is 23806951
